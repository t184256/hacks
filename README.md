hacks, a Python plugin library that doesn't play by the rules
-------------------------------------------------------------

`hacks` is distributed under the terms of the MIT License;
see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

This package currently lacks nice documentation.

Please see [`test_hacks.py`](./test_hacks.py) for usage examples.

In a nutshell, it allows extending code explicitly,
but encourages practices that are usually frowned upon.
